# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using React. It allows users to add, delete, mark tasks as completed, restore completed tasks, and rearrange tasks.

- **Delete Task**: Tasks can be deleted from the list of active or completed tasks.
- **Complete Task**: Users can mark tasks as completed and move them to a separate "Completed" section.
- **Move Tasks**: Tasks can be moved up or down within the list.
- **Restore Task**: Completed tasks can be restored to the active list.
- **Responsive UI**: The application adjusts to the number of tasks.

## Functionality

- **Adding Tasks**: Tasks are added by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Task Actions**:
  - Click on the task number to mark it as completed.
  - Use the up/down arrows to move tasks within the active list.
